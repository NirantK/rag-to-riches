However, SETMAR, also known as Metnase, is known in the scientific literature to possess a transposase domain. This domain is derived from a mariner-family transposase, which is fused to a SET domain that has histone methyltransferase activity. This fusion allows SETMAR to participate in DNA repair and other genomic functions. For a more detailed and specific confirmation, fu...   \n",
