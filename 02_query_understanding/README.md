# Query Understanding

This is part of the [Search for RAG](../README.md) course. Here, we will be creating dynamic query decompositions, expansions, and annotations using LLMs. 

## Dataset

1. E-commerce Queries are from [Amazon ESCI Dataset](https://github.com/amazon-science/esci-data)
2. Apollo Search Schemas for both people and companies are based on their [REST API Docs](https://apolloio.github.io/apollo-api-docs/?shell#introduction)
3. Financial Queries are synthetic queries generated using a LLM based on HDFC Bank's Home Page.
