# Query Understanding and Processing

This module focuses on techniques for understanding and processing user queries in RAG systems.

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. Query Analysis
- Query intent classification
- Entity recognition
- Query decomposition
- Semantic understanding
- Query normalization

### 2. Query Expansion
- Keyword expansion
- Semantic expansion
- Context-aware expansion
- Multi-query generation
- Query reformulation strategies

### 3. Query Processing
- Preprocessing techniques
- Query cleaning
- Stop word handling
- Special character processing
- Language detection

## Implementation Details
- Query preprocessing pipelines
- Intent classification models
- Entity extraction tools
- Query expansion algorithms
- Evaluation metrics for query understanding

## Resources
- Benchmark datasets
- Example implementations

## Dataset

1. E-commerce Queries are from [Amazon ESCI Dataset](https://github.com/amazon-science/esci-data)
2. Apollo Search Schemas for both people and companies are based on their [REST API Docs](https://apolloio.github.io/apollo-api-docs/?shell#introduction)
3. Financial Queries are synthetic queries generated using a LLM based on HDFC Bank's Home Page.
